          <p align="justify">The six GCE Learning Outcomes are integrated in program offerings as a   component of Centennial&rsquo;s Signature Learning Experience (SLE).   Centennial College students have an opportunity to learn about these   concepts, develop their critical thinking and analysis skills, and   participate in meaningful projects. Integrating GCE Learning Outcomes   into the curriculum works to develop in each student and faculty member   the competencies for learning, teaching and working that value diversity   and difference, and embrace and promote equity and inclusion amongst   all students and staff (CC Intranet).</p>

          <p>Every year, millions of women and girls worldwide suffer violence, be it   domestic violence, rape, female genital mutilation/cutting, dowry-related   killing, trafficking, sexual violence in conflict-related situations, or other   manifestations of abuse.Violence against women takes many forms – physical, sexual, psychological and   economic. These forms of violence are interrelated and affect women from before   birth to old age. Some types of violence, such as trafficking, cross national   boundaries.</p>
          <p>Women and girls who experience violence suffer a range of health problems and   their ability to participate in public life is diminished. Violence against   women harms families and communities across generations and reinforces other   violence prevalent in society. Violence against women also impoverishes women, their families, communities   and nations. </p>
          <h3>Violence by an intimate partner </h3>
          <p>The most common form of violence experienced by women globally is physical   violence inflicted by an intimate partner, with women beaten, coerced into sex   or otherwise abused. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A World Health Organization (WHO) study in 11 countries found that the   percentage of women who had been subjected to sexual violence by an intimate   partner ranged from 6 per cent in Japan to 59 per cent in Ethiopia.</li>
            <li>Several global surveys suggest that half of all women who die from homicide   are killed by their current or former husbands or partners.</li>
            <li>In Australia, Canada, Israel, South Africa and the United States, 40 to 70   per cent of female murder victims were killed by their partners, according to   the World Health Organization. </li>
            <li>In Colombia, one woman is reportedly killed by her partner or former partner   every six days.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Factors that contribute to violence against women </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>low levels of education (for boys associated with perpetrating violence in   the future and for girls, experiencing violence); </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>limited economic opportunities (an aggravating factor for unemployed or   underemployed men associated with perpetrating violence; and as a risk factor   for women and girls, including of domestic abuse, child and forced marriage, and   sexual exploitation and trafficking); </li>
            <li>the presence of economic, educational and employment disparities between men   and women in an intimate relationship; </li>
            <li>conflict and tension within an intimate partner relationship or marriage; </li>
            <li>women’s insecure access to and control over property and land rights; </li>
            <li>male control over decision-making and assets; </li>
            <li>attitudes and practices that reinforce female subordination and tolerate   male violence (e.g. dowry,  bride price, child marriage); </li>
            <li>lack of safe spaces for women and girls, which can be physical or virtual   meeting spaces that allow free expression and communication; a place to develop   friendships and social networks, engage with mentors and seek advice from a   supportive  environment. </li>
            <li>normalized use of violence within the family or society to address conflict; </li>
            <li>a limited legislative and policy framework for preventing and responding to   violence; </li>
            <li>lack of punishment (impunity) for perpetrators of violence; and, </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="TabbedPanelsContent">We should raise our standard of thinking for the women as they are too part of this society. They should be given all the rights that men have. women should be respected.
Moreover following are the things that we should do uplift women in the society:
          <ul>
            <li>completion of secondary education for girls (and boys); </li>
            <li>delaying age of marriage to 18;</li>
            <li>women’s economic autonomy and access to skills training, credit and   employment; </li>
            <li>social norms that promote gender equality; </li>
            <li>quality response services (judicial, security/protection, social and   medical) staffed with knowledgeable, skilled and trained personnel; </li>
            <li>availability of safe spaces or shelters; and, </li>
            <li>access to support groups. </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Role of media in prompting the social justice
            
          </h4>
          <p>Punjab Assembly has unanimously passed a legislation known as The Punjab   Protection of Women Against Violence Act 2016 which aims at discouraging and   preventing domestic violence against women and to provide the affected women a   legal avenue to get their grievanced addressed. The Islamic Ideology Council has   already declared un-Islamic and it has also been challenged in The Shariat   court. Maulana Fazlur Rahman also holds the same views and has announced to   launch a campaign to protect the rights of men. Consequently an intense debate   is raging in the media on the subject.<br />
            Honestly speaking it is hard to deny   that violence against women exists at all levels of the society and has diverse   forms. It ranges from abusive language, coercion in marriage, wife-beating,   torture, marital rape, custodial violence, honour killing, burning, acid   throwing, incest , rape, gang rape, public stripping, trafficking, forced   prostitution and sexual harassment. Many forms that exist are so entrenched in   our culture that they are ignored, condoned or even found acceptable by large   sections of our society. For example social attitudes that the wife is a   property of the husband; that whatever happens in a family is a private,   internal family matter; that behavior meted out to the wife was necessary as   corrective measures. It all leads to the condoning of acts of violence and abuse   towards women in their roles as wives.<br />
            Our is a society dominated by male   chauvinism. The foregoing practices are immoral, against human dignity as well   as illegal. Domestic violence is a legal offence in almost all the countries of   the world. Almost all the religions abhor this kind of behavior or social   environment. In Sura Al-Nisa God commands men to treat their women fairly.   Treating them fairly implies a violence free domestic environment. Quran does   not allow men to commit the foregoing crimes and resort to the detestable social   practice of violence against women.</p>
